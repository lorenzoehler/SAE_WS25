Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Bolivia 2008 DHS GPS data.  
The data named BOGE51FL had the latitude and longitude field names switch.  
Also, one cluster 6062 was missing a latitude value.  These issues were resolved in the data file BOGE52FL. 
This correction has also been included in the data file BOGE53FL.
Please use these data for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  
We apologize for any confusion this may cause you.
